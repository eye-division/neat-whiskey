_Sound Pool_ presented visitors with a virtual pool of water reflecting local skies,
accompanied by a slowly shifting chordal soundscape. Movement in the space caused ripples 
across the pool's surface, which in turn brought into focus sounds from everyday Banbury, 
before slowly dissolving away again. Visitors could play with the installation like a large,
intuitive instrument. Others could simply sit and absorb the fragmented narratives and familiar
snatches of sound as others moved about, or wait a few minutes for a short shower of 'rain' 
to bring forth a new selection of sounds like the retuning of a radio.
